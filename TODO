 
 * player overview page
 * display elo rating in reports
 * profile should display kill/death/cap/... diagram
 * Player.serialize should be in profile.py
 * nick.log should use max instead of sum for attributes like streaks
 * Store elo in nicklog
 * Do not show gauntlet in profile hitrate diagram
 * try http://code.google.com/intl/de-DE/apis/charttools/index.html for charts

== Maybe sometimes ==

 * better player profiles
 * support other game types than CTF
 * player achievements
 * award images
 * interactive profile diagrams (display value and map at mouseover dot)
 * dark color scheme?
 * better elo calculation
