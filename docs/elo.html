		<h1>ArenaELO</h1>
		<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">ELO rating system</a>
		is the most prominent system to rank players relatively to each other.
		This document describes, how ArenaStats does it (Currently: will do it!).</p>

		<p>The rough idea of ELO is this:
		For every game the result is predicted from the participating players ranking.
		Using the difference between the actual game result and the prediction,
		the player ratings are adapted.</p>

		<h2>Inspirations</h2>

		<h3>Microsoft TrueSkill™</h3>
		<p>The <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/trueskill/details.aspx">TrueSkill™</a>
		system is one of the most advanced ELO variations
		and is used for example to rank online XBoX Live games.
		Instead of a simple rating value a gaussian distribution is used,
		so the certainty of rating is included in the calculations.
		For reasons of simplicity,
		ArenaELO uses a single value for now.</p>

		<h2>Prethinking</h2>
		
		<p>The requirements:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The system must handle team games (CTF)</li>
			<li>The sum must be constant. So rating points can only be redistributed.</li>
			<li>For a constant group of players, the ratings should reach a fixed point,
			which corresponds to the skill of the players.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Values like flag captures are highly dependent on team combinations and strategy,
		while the frag count is relatively stable.
		The basic value for prediction and rating is thus
		the <em>frag quotient</em>,
		which is the sum of all frags divided by the players frags.
		This means that there is no difference in calculation
		between the deathmatch, team deathmatch and CTF game modes.
		</p>

		<h2>The math</h2>
		
		<p>Every player p has a rating r, where r is the current skill rating.
		For a new player the rating 1.</p>

		<p>To predict the frag quotients fq of a game,
		the rating quotient rq<sub>p</sub> of each player is calculated via
		rq<sub>p</sub> = R/r<sub>p</sub>,
		where R is the sum of all ratings of the participating players.
		Finally, for every player p the predicted frag quotient 
		fq<sub>p</sub>=rq<sub>p</sub>.
		</p>

		<p>The actual game results yields frag quotients fq'<sub>p</sub>,
		which differ from the prediction by d<sub>p</sub>=fq'<sub>p</sub>-fq<sub>p</sub>.
		The sum of all quotients is 1 of course,
		so the sum of all d<sub>p</sub> is 0.
		Since the quotient depends on the number of players n,
		d<sub>p</sub> is multiplied by n.
		Also an absorption factor a is included to stabilize the ratings.
		Finally, the new rating of a player can be calculated via the product
		r'<sub>p</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;r<sub>p</sub>+d<sub>p</sub>na.
		</p>

		<h2>Examples</h2>

		<p>For the examples we assume the absorption factor a=0.1.</p>

		<h3>1 on 1</h3>

		<p>Consider a 1on1 game Sarge vs Major.
		Since both players are unrated,
		they get an initial rating of 1.
		Therefore the predicted frag quotients are 0.5 each.
		</p>

		<p>Sarge wins the game with 13:7 frags.
		Thus, the actual frag quotients are 13/20=0.65 and 7/20=0.35
		and the differences +0.15 and -0.15.
		Sarges rating after game is
		1+0.15⋅2⋅0.1=1.03.
		Majors rating accordingly is
		1+(-0.15)⋅2⋅0.1=0.97.
		</p>

		<h3>Three players</h3>

		<p>For a more complex scenario consider a match of three players
		with different ratings.</p>

		<table>
			<tr><th>Player</th><th>r</th>   <th>rq = fq</th><th>fq'</th> <th>d</th>
			                   <th>r'</th></tr>
			<tr><td>Sarge</td> <td>1.03</td><td>0.29</td>   <td>0.32</td><td>+0.03</td>
			                   <td>1.04 = 1.03+0.03⋅3⋅0.1</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Major</td> <td>0.97</td><td>0.28</td>   <td>0.23</td><td>-0.05</td>
			                   <td>0.95 = 0.97+(-0.05)⋅3⋅0.1</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Xaero</td> <td>1.50</td><td>0.43</td>   <td>0.45</td><td>+0.02</td>
			                   <td>1.51 = 1.50+0.02⋅3⋅0.1</td></tr>
			<tr class="total"><td></td>
			                   <td>3.50</td>  <td>1.00</td>   <td>1.00</td><td>+0.0</td>
												 <td>3.50</td></tr>
		</table>

		<p>In this scenario you can see that the sum is constant.
		Also the predicted outcome matched the actual game results quite well,
		so the ratings stay relatively stable.
		</p>

		<h3>Misprediction</h3>

		<p>Here is what happens,
		if the previous game would have had a surprising result.
		</p>

		<table>
			<tr><th>Player</th><th>r</th>   <th>rq = fq</th><th>fq'</th> <th>d</th>
			                   <th>r'</th></tr>
			<tr><td>Sarge</td> <td>1.03</td><td>0.29</td>   <td>0.32</td><td>+0.03</td>
			                   <td>1.04 = 1.03+0.03⋅3⋅0.1</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Major</td> <td>0.97</td><td>0.28</td>   <td>0.43</td><td>+0.15</td>
			                   <td>1.01 = 0.97+0.15⋅3⋅0.1</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Xaero</td> <td>1.50</td><td>0.43</td>   <td>0.25</td><td>-0.18</td>
			                   <td>1.45 = 1.50+(-0.18)⋅3⋅0.1</td></tr>
			<tr class="total"><td></td>
			                   <td>3.50</td>  <td>1.00</td>   <td>1.00</td><td>+0.0</td>
												 <td>3.50</td></tr>
		</table>
